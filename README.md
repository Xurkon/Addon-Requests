# 🚀 Addon Requests & Backports

Welcome to the central hub for requesting new Addons or Backports for World of Warcraft (supporting Vanilla, TBC, and WotLK clients).

This repository is maintained by **Xurkon** to keep track of community needs and requested features.

## 💡 How to make a request

To ensure your request is seen and understood, please follow these steps:

1. **Check Existing Requests:** Go to the [Issues](https://github.com/Xurkon/Addon-Requests/issues) tab and see if someone else has already requested the same thing. If they have, give it a 👍 reaction to boost its visibility!
2. **Choose the Right Template:** Click on **[New Issue](https://github.com/Xurkon/Addon-Requests/issues/new/choose)** and select either:
   - **🆕 New Addon Request**: For entirely new ideas or features.
   - **🔄 Backport Request**: For existing addons that need to be made compatible with older clients.
3. **Fill out the Form:** Provide as much detail as possible. Links to source code, screenshots of the original addon, and the specific client version (e.g., 3.3.5a) are extremely helpful.
4. **Vote with Upvotes:** I prioritize work based on community interest. Upvote the ideas you want to see implemented!

## 🛠 Status Labels

I use labels to keep you updated on where your request stands:

- `🟢 Accepted`: The request is approved and added to the roadmap.
- `🟡 In Progress`: Work has started on this addon/backport.
- `🔍 Researching`: Investigating if the request is technically possible.
- `🔴 Rejected`: The request is either impossible to implement or does not align with current goals.

## 📢 Note on Backports
When requesting a backport, please ensure the addon's license allows for modification and redistribution. If the original author is still active, I recommend reaching out to them first.
